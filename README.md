## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - TailwindCSS framework
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - Simple React forms validation
- [react-number-format](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-number-format) - Input formatting library
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Animation library

### What I learned

This was quite a challenging project as it was the first I have worked on using both [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

I have found Next.js to be quite a convenient framework to use and with a smooth learning curve for someone with experience with React.js. TailwindCSS on the other hand has had quite a steep learning curve as it is the first CSS framework I have used, but I very much enjoy using it and intend to use it as well in the future.

It is also my first time using the [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) animation library for adding animations when components are removed or added to the React tree. This is acheived using the `<AnimatePresence>` component wrapper for the `<motion>` element.
